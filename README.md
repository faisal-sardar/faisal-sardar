-   Hi !!!

please don't hesitate asking my CV,
Thanks for visiting my page,
i am a Data Engineer & Bioinformatician

I am a results-driven Data Engineer with a proven track record of designing, building, and optimizing scalable data architectures. My expertise spans cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, where I develop robust data pipelines that empower businesses to make data-driven decisions. I excel at solving complex data challenges, implementing data governance and security protocols, and optimizing storage solutions to meet business objectives.

Currently, I serve as Senior Data Engineer at Metasol, a dynamic startup, where I not only develop and maintain high-performance ETL pipelines but also lead and manage a talented team of engineers. I am responsible for designing the data architecture, automating database processes, and ensuring data accuracy across our systems. Under my leadership, we’ve consistently improved pipeline performance, reduced processing times, and implemented cutting-edge solutions for data provisioning and governance.

With a strong background in bioinformatics and healthcare data, I have successfully led projects that integrate clinical, operational, and administrative data across healthcare systems, ensuring scalability, performance, and regulatory compliance. My work includes architecting cloud-based solutions, securing sensitive data, and collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to align our data strategy with long-term business goals.

Key Skills:

Data Engineering (ETL/ELT, Data Warehousing, Cloud Data Solutions)
Cloud Platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
Data Governance & Security (HIPAA, GDPR Compliance)
Database Performance Optimization
Data Modeling (Dimensional, Physical & Logical)
AI (Machine Learning and Deep Learning)
Team Leadership & Management
SQL, Python, Snowflake, Matillion
I am passionate about staying ahead of the curve with the latest technologies and trends, and I am always looking for new opportunities to apply my skills to solve complex data challenges and lead innovative projects.
